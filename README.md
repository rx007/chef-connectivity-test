Chef Connectivity Tester
========================
This repo contains a small Ruby script that can be used to test your connection to Opscode's Chef Server. This is very useful for training courses, to ensure you have met all the pre-requisite steps.


Assumptions
-----------
- You are using Opscode's omnibus installer at the default location
- You have successfully registered for Enterprise Chef and downloaded your Starter Kit
- **You are running these commands from inside your Starter Kit chef-repo**


Usage
-----
1. Download the `check` script inside the `bin` directory of this repo
1. Move the `check` script into your `chef-repo`
1. Execute the script from a terminal from within your chef-repo:

        (chef)   $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby check
        (chefdk) $ /opt/chefdk/embedded/bin/ruby check

    If you are using Windows, your path is slightly different:

        $ C:/opscode/chef/embedded/bin/ruby.exe check

This will test some common endpoints when working with Chef, such as:

- Connecting to GitHub
- Connecting to a Chef Server
- Downloading a Cookbook
- Establishing an SSH connection


Development
-----------
1. Fork/clone the repository on GitHub
2. Submit patches as Pull Requests
